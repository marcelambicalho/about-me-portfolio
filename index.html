<p class="intro-paragraph"> 🟢 Hi! I’m Marcela, a Business Analytics & Economics major, data-driven social impact enthusiast and a second-year student in London with experience in Python, Excel, SQL, and data storytelling. </p>
                <p class="intro-paragraph"> 🟢 My hobbies include drawing, reading, learning languages and swimming (whenever I can, England is freezing during most of the academic year 😭) </p>

    <div class="fun-section">
            <h2 class="fun-header"> fun facts </h2>
            <p> 1️⃣ I basically live in two countries during the year (London for uni, Brazil for summer break!)</p> 
            <p>2️⃣ I did not know I would be going to study abroad until like 2 months before I had to move! </p>
            <p> 3️⃣ The only bone I've ever broken in my body is one of my toes, and I broke it bumping it in my own room (maybe a fun fact for you, but definitely not for me 😅)</p>
